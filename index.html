        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Devanna Temple Watts, a passionate web developer with a love for creating elegant and functional websites. 
            I specialize in front-end development, JavaScript, CSS, C++, Cybersecurity, 
            and I'm dedicated to delivering exceptional user experiences.
    
            My journey in web development began when I took my first computer class in college, 
            and since then, I've had the privilege of working on a variety of exciting projects that have honed my skills 
            and allowed me to collaborate with other talented individuals in my school.
    
            In every project, I strive to combine creativity and innovation to craft websites that not only look great 
            but also perform flawlessly. I am constantly learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends 
            to ensure that my work remains cutting-edge.
    
            Beyond coding, I am an Army Veteran, a dancer, cook, painter, and artist. 
            When I'm not at my computer, you can find me playing with my cat, reading a book, belly dancing, or cooking some southern food.
    
            Let's connect and discuss how I can help bring your web development projects to life. 
            Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my recent work, and don't hesitate to reach out (devannaw@yahoo.com). </p>

            <p>    This is my final exam project I created in my Web Development class my first semester at USV. I was very proud 
                of how well it turned out. I wanted to create a student planner that was very functional for me, and also cute.
